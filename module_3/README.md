# Introduction to Scrapy
## Scrapy Shell command
- Use the _shell_ command + a URL to make a direct request to the website
- We often get a "403 - forbidden" response, meaning the website has identified us a bot and banned us
- We have access to different objects like _response_ and _request_ and attributes like _headers_ and _status_
